# Task Page Architecture Design

## Current State
- Single-page application with modals
- Tasks displayed in grid format
- Modal-based task creation/editing

## Target State
- Multi-page routing system
- Dedicated task pages with URL structure: `/task/{task_id}`
- Rich task pages with milestones, files, chat, help system

## URL Structure
```
/ - Dashboard (main page)
/task/{id} - Individual task page
/project/{id} - Project page

```

## Task Page Components

- Version tracking

### Help & Notifications
- "I Need Help" button per milestone
- Notification system to relevant users
- Context-aware help requests

### Communication
