Stage 1: Invitation Structure, Trusted families, Trusted Humans Network 
Introduction
	•	Purpose: The liberation of humanity through an economic system rooted in
Universal Law. Establish a secure and trusted network foundation for the Parallax protocols.
	•	Objectives: Controlled growth, high trust, robust verification, and efficient network expansion.

2. Invitation Structure
The beginning starts with the founders each getting 3 invites.
	•	Invitation Limits:
	•	Each new user invites three new participants. This continues.
	•	Invitation Process:
	•	The parent of a new family is responsible for arranging a live online meeting where all five individuals (grandparent, parent, and the three new children) verify each other’s authenticity and decided whether they wish to form a family unit.
	•	Responsibilities:
The parent and grandparent are responsible for explaining how Parallax works to the new family members. The new family members are responsible for verifying the invitation history authenticity of the parent and grandparent.
	•	Verification:
When a new trusted family unit is being formed, an individual photo of all new members is automatically taken and compared to the existing user database. If there is a match, the parent is informed and will need to verify whether the individual is in fact already in the system. The parent is shown some information from the potential matching account, and is presented with questions to ask the new family member to ascertain the situation.
	•	Verification Mechanism:
	•	Private voting by each member to accept or reject the formation of a trusted family.
	•	Grandparents and parents share encrypted credentials with new users’ to confirm their invitation history on the network.
3. Trusted families
	•	Definition: Virtual family units consisting of a grandparent, parent, and three children.
	•	Family Roles:
	•	Grandparent: Initiates the invitation.
	•	Parent: Invited by the grandparent and invites three children.
	•	Children: New members invited by the parent. 
Family Formation:
	•	All five members must concurrently verify each other on a live call.
	•	Private votes determine whether to form the family; if any member declines, the family is dissolved and reformed. 
	Multiple Memberships:
	•	Members belong to both their inviter’s family and their own invited family, creating interconnected trust networks.

4. Trusted Humans Network
	•	Human-Centric Verification:
	•	Real-time live calls ensure each participant is a unique, authentic human.
	•	Encrypted invite trees maintain the security and legitimacy of invitations.
	•	Network Cap:
	•	Soft Cap: Initial goal of 144,000 users.
	•	Scalability: After reaching and stabilizing at a balanced position around the soft cap, the network may expand based on DAO decision
	•	Adaptability: Allows for growth even below the cap to account for user attrition.

5. Forced Invite Growth
	•	Time Constraint:
	•	New Users have three days to invite their three children.
	•	Limited Access for New Users:
	•	New users can only access the learning portal and communicate with their parent and grandparent during the invitation period.
	•	Encouraging Engagement:
	•	Promotes active participation and swift network expansion.

6. Implementation Steps
	•	Onboarding Process:
	•	Virtual family formation through live calls.
	•	Verification of existing users (grandparent and parents) in the network by the new users via encrypted credentials. Designed to prevent sybil attacks, new users will check the trusted family units of their inviting party, ensuring no duplicate humans exist in their family tree.
	•	Private voting to confirm family unit.
	•	Initial Setup:
	•	Establishing trusted family structures.
	•	Ensuring all members meet trust and authenticity criteria. 

	•	Growth Management:
	•	Monitoring network stability before expanding beyond the soft cap.
	•	Replacing inactive users to maintain network integrity.
	 •	In the event of user attrition, trusted families are responsible for inviting new users into their family unit.

7. Security Measures
	•	Proof of Human Sequence & Multi Factor Authentication:
	•	Ensures only verified humans join the network.
	•	Multi-Factor Authentication for all users enhances security. 2FA achieved via email or Authenticator apps.
	•	Encrypted Invite Trees:
	•	Securely manage and store invitation data.
	•	Conflict Resolution:
	•	Basic protocols to handle disputes during family formation and voting processes.
8. Benefits
	•	Enhanced Trust:
	•	Verified human identities ensure network integrity and reliability.
	•	Controlled Growth:
	•	Invitation limits and forced invite growth maintain quality and exclusivity.
	•	Robust Security:
	•	Advanced verification and encryption protect against fraudulent participation.
	•	Efficient Expansion:
	•	Virtual families allow for rapid and scalable network growth without physical constraints.

9. Technical Specifications

	•	Objectives: Develop detailed user profiles, establish communities, and enable project management to foster engagement and ecosystem growth.

2. User Profiles
	•	Profile Components:
	•	Basic Information: Username, avatar, bio.
	•	Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Secure, self-sovereign identities linked to reputation scores.
	•	Skills and Interests: Users list their skills and areas of interest to facilitate matching.
	•	Reputation Score: Reflects trustworthiness based on prior interactions.
	•	Customization:
	•	Privacy Controls: Users manage visibility of their information.
	•	Achievement Badges: Display milestones and accomplishments.
	•	Interactivity:
	•	Profile Editing: Users can update their information and skills.
	•	Connections: Options to add friends, message, or collaborate with others. (Minting Tokens, and sharing knowledge).

3. Communities
	•	Formation:

	•	Event Management: Schedule and organize workshops or meetings.
	•	Governance:
	•	Moderation: Assign community leaders or moderators.
	•	Voting: Enable members to vote on community decisions.

4. Project Profiles
	•	Creation:
	•	Initiation: Define project goals, roles, and required skills.
	•	Token Allocation: Request tokens for funding based on milestones. Tokens are crowd-funded through community voting, and core team members have an opportunity to add additional presence tokens to continue funding their project. Crowd-funded tokens unlock based on milestones set by the project.
	•	Components:
	•	Description: Overview of project purpose and objectives.
	•	Team Members: List participants with roles and skills.
	•	Milestones: Define actionable steps with deadlines and token distribution mechanics.

	•	Collaboration Tools:
	•	Task Management: Assign and track tasks.
	•	Communication: Integrated chat or video conferencing.
	•	Document Collaboration: Shared editing of project documents.

5. Onboarding and Engagement
	•	Transition from Stage 1:
	•	Users move from forming trusted families to building profiles and engaging in projects.
	•	Decentralized Check System:
	•	AI Matchmaking: Automatically matches users to relevant work packages.
	•	Task Validation: Users complete decentralized checks to validate work packages.
	•	Rewards: Presence tokens and skill tree advancements for completed checks.

6. Token Minting and Validation
	•	Basic Token Minting:
	•	Users mint tokens through meaningful work and earn tokens by validation.
	•	Validation Process: A specific percentage of validators (ex: 7/9 or 77%) must approve the token for it to progress to the next layer
	•	Initial Validation: Your trusted family automatically accepts any work packages you have created, with any beings, anywhere on the network.
        • Human layer validation: Human experts with the most experience in related fields perform human layer validation. 
	•	AI Review: 7 of 9 of the AI agents also must approve the work, in a second-layer validation. 
	•	Validation Outcome:
	•	Failed: Tokens remain sandboxed within the last successful validation layer. 
	•	Passed: Tokens become universally accepted and recorded on the blockchain.
	•	Consensus: Upon final layer of validation, consensus is achieved through synchronization of DWNs (Decentralized Web Nodes) and blockchain storage. User’s DID’s are used to sign the token upon minting, and same for every validator. Once the token achieves general acceptance status, then all signatures are stripped from the token and stored as a unique hash on the blockchain.  
7. Reputation System
	•	Feedback Mechanism:
	•	Impact rating: When two or more users interact (while minting tokens, exchanging tokens or while working within a project) all parties are asked to rate each other on their experience. A simple system of 😀(+), 😐(0), or ☹️(-) is used to represent how a user feels towards another in that interaction. In order to disincentivize malicious use, scores cannot go beyond 😀(+1) or ☹️(-1). This system incentivizes users to co-create with more beings. A history of ratings is available by clicking on the current emoji. 
	•	Feedback: Validators offer feedback during the validation process, offering constructive criticism based on their skills and knowledge.
	•	Skill Tree Advancement:
	•	Skill Levels: Skills increase as users engage their skills in related tasks and/or validation of related tasks.
	•	Impact: Higher skills enhance matchmaking and project opportunities.

8. User Journey and Experience
	•	Empowerment:
	•	Users feel motivated to explore and engage through gamified elements.
	•	Reputation Building:
	•	Positive interactions build trust and reputation within the network.

9. Technical Specifications
	•	Smart Contracts:
	•	Manage profiles, token minting, and validation processes.
	•	Encryption and Security:
	•	Secure credential sharing and data protection.
	•	AI Integration:
	•	Facilitate matchmaking and ensure relevant task assignments.

Stage 3: Project Voting, Skill Tree, User Matching

1. Introduction
	•	Purpose: Empower users to influence projects, develop skills, and engage actively within the ecosystem.
	•	Objectives: Users and projects are matched with one another. Skill-trees are built via collaborating with others. Users (as well as projects) are able to attract and connect with one another based on their skills and needs. Users vote for the projects they feel are the most exciting and important for humanity.

2. User Experience
	•	Users complete validation tasks to verify work and earn presence tokens.

3. Presence Tokens
	•	Earning Tokens:
	•	Validation Work: Earn tokens by validating work packages.
	•	Skill Advancement: Increase skills through task completion, enhancing future matching opportunities.
	•	Spending Tokens:
	•	Voting: Use tokens to vote on projects, influencing their funding and progression.

4. Voting Mechanism
	•	Vote Types:
	•	Swipe Right: Vote “Yes” (-0.167 tokens)
	•	Swipe Left: Vote “No” (-0.167 tokens)
	•	Swipe Up: “Super-Yes” (custom token amount)
	•	Swipe Down: “Abstain, show me next” (no token cost)
	•	Token Costs:
	•	Standard Votes: 0.167 tokens per yes/no vote (1 presence token = 6 votes)
	•	Super-Yes: Variable tokens as chosen by the user
	•	Abstain: No cost
	•	Vote Outcomes:
	•	Yes/Super-Yes: Fund the project further.
	•	No: Tokens recycled into a pool and redistributed to active voters in the past 24 hours.
	•	Abstain: Skip to the next project without spending tokens.

5. Project Funding and Badging
	•	Funding Process:
	•	Kickstarter Style: Projects require a certain vote ratio and threshold to pass the voting phase.
	•	Badge Awarding: Successful projects receive a gold badge stating “Passed voting phase on DD/MM/YYYY with a X:Y ratio.”
	•	Badge Benefits:
	•	Increased Likelihood of Continued Funding: Acts as a mark of honour, encouraging ongoing project support.
	 •	Longterm Revenue: Projects may continue to pay monthly to list their projects ensuring steady revenue.

6. Prize Pool and Rewards:
•	   Prize Pool: Users are rewarded for voting on projects. One main prize pool is created, and 	all successfully funded projects provide prizes to be distributed to voters.
	•	Formation: Users receive lottery tickets equal to the tokens they’ve spent on “Yes or No” votes in the past 24 hours. Every 24 hours users have a chance to win prizes from all projects that have been completed. 
	•	Prize Allocation:
	•	Successful Projects: Offer a percentage of goods sold on Parallax Exchange back to voters via a prize pool.
	•	Trading Prizes: Users must claim their prize digitally, or can list unwanted prizes on the Parallax Exchange at -10% below the project’s price. This must be done before receiving the prize. Projects fulfill prize pool orders each month before sales orders.

7. Presence Token Recycling Scenario:
	•	Total Users: 14,400
	•	Active Users Voting: 1/8 of 14,400 = 1,800 users
	•	Average Tokens Spent per User per 24hrs: 3.5 tokens
	•	Yes Votes: 2 tokens (12 votes)
	•	No Votes: 1.5 token (9 votes)
	•	Total Tokens Spent:
	•	Yes: 1,800 users * 2 tokens = 3,600 tokens
	•	No: 1,800 users * 1.5 token = 2,700 tokens
	•	Recycled Presence Tokens:
	•	From “No” Votes: 2,700 tokens
	•	Redistribution: 2,700 tokens distributed equally to 1,800 active voters = 1.5 token each

8. “No” Votes as Temporary Experts
	•	Logging “No” Votes:
	•	DID Logging: When a user votes “No,” on a project or DAO proposal, their DID is logged by the project.
	•	Work Requests for Feedback:
	•	Trigger: If a project fails to meet the required vote ratio, it can request feedback.
	•	Targeted DIDs: Work requests are sent to DIDs that voted “No,” marking them as “temporary experts.”
	•	Feedback Process:
	•	Presence Token Allocation: Projects allocate presence tokens for providing feedback.
	•	User Participation: Experts can accept the request to provide feedback, earning a portion of the allocated tokens.
	•	Benefits:
	•	Quality Feedback: Projects receive valuable insights to improve.
	•	Constructive Criticism: No votes become valuable to projects.
	•	Reputation Enhancement: Experts gain recognition and tokens for their contributions.
 
Stage 4: Decentralized Presence Token Minting, Token Validation, Reputation System

1. Introduction
	•	Purpose: Establish a decentralized system for minting presence tokens, validating token transactions, and implementing a robust reputation framework.
	•	Objectives: Ensure fair token distribution, secure validation processes, and transparent reputation tracking to maintain network integrity and trust.

2. Presence Token Minting
	•	Minting Methods: Minting can be either single-user, multi-user or project based, allowing flexibility in collaboration structures.
	•	Collaborative Minting: Users can mint tokens by collaborating with others without waiting for community approval.
	•	Project Minting: Users can participate in team settings, undertaking large-scale, world-changing projects. Projects offer higher rewards as the community has approved the project.
	
	•	Token Distribution:
	•	General Minting: All users earn a base rate of 1 presence token per hour regardless of where the work occurs.
	•	Project-Based Minting: When working within a community-approved project, users may earn an additional presence token per hour (totalling 2 tokens per hour), reflecting the higher value and community support of these projects. These tokens are accrued through users voting for projects, and donations.
	•	Smart Contracts: Automate token distribution based on project milestones.

3. Result of Token Validation within a Trusted family:
	•	Passed Validation: When any member of a trusted family validates a work package, the entirety of their trusted family structure accept the work package since all individuals in their family unit are trusted. The tokens minted in exchange for that work package can now be circulated between users who have validated it as valid currency and their extended family. 
	•	Failed Validation: When any member of a trusted family records a no in response to a work package, that package is not accepted by their family. 
4. Reputation System
	•	Reputation Metrics:
	•	Interactions Only: Reputation is built solely through user interactions, not through validations.
	•	Single Ranking per Interaction: Users can rank each other once per interaction (+1, 0, -1).
	•	Accumulated Reputation: Each user’s feedback toward another user counts only once. For example, if Billy trades with Sally five times and she gives him a +1 rating each time, Billy still only receives a single +1 from Sally. If Billy earns positive feedback from five other people, his total score would be +6. With 100 unique positive interactions, his rating could grow to +100.
	•	Reputation Display:
	•	Dartboard UI:
	•	Bullseye: Represents the total number of users that have toggled on “trust” with this user, including trust family members and other network users, colour-coded. This number represents how many people will accept this users currency automatically.
	•	Inner Ring: Represents what your friends think about this user. Users can friend any other user, at any time. This reputation layer allows the user to leverage their real life trusted connections to make make better decisions on who they want to interact with on the network.
	•	Outer Ring: Represents the users’ global interactions reputation.
	•	Trust Management:
	•	Toggle Trust: Users can discreetly reduce trust in a family member, affecting the inner bullseye colour.
	•	Mediator Intervention: If >50% of a user’s family units toggle off trust, a mediator is appointed to resolve the issue.
	•	Network Trust: Users can toggle trust on/off with other users on the global network. This allows for the same functionality which occurs inside the trusted family unit to occur with select users outside of the family. All work packages approved by the trusted member outside the family automatically become accepted currency by the user.

5. Enhanced Validation and Feedback Mechanism
	•	Work-Based Validation:
	•	Project Teams: Users collaborate on projects, minting tokens through meaningful work. All successful projects have passed the voting phase, which means they have tokens available that have been crowd-funded. These tokens are distributed to project team members as they complete project work, alongside the standard tokens that are minted.
	•	Validation by Network: Tokens are automatically validated by trusted family members, then by human experts, then finally by AI.

6. Overspending Within Projects
	•	Scenario Handling:
	•	Token Over-Expenditure:
	•	Trigger: If a project exceeds its presence token balance expectations (e.g., milestone 1: expected 30 tokens, actual 45).
	•	Accountability Requests: Users who voted “Yes” on the project are sent work requests to hold the project accountable.
	•	Second Round Funding:
	•	User Approval: If reasons for extra token expenditure are approved, users who initially voted “yes” are asked to contribute additional tokens in increments of 0.167 and above.
	•	Token Allocation:
	•	Success: If the extra tokens are raised in the second round, project members can claim these tokens via further milestones.
	•	Failure: If insufficient support is received, whatever tokens raised are shared among project members submitting work to milestones and core-team members are tasked with raising the remainder of the tokens required to achieve the milestones by donating presence tokens they earn on the network into their own project pool.

7. Demurrage on Presence Tokens
	•	Burn Rate:
	•	Timeframe: Presence tokens held beyond a certain period of time are subject to demurrage.
	•	Incentivized Spending: Encourages circulation of tokens and prevents hoarding.
	•	Economic Stability: Controls token inflation, ensuring a dynamic and active token economy.

Stage 5: Parallax Exchange Marketplace, Decentralized Governance, Keshe Foundation Wellness & Feeding by Plasmatic Fields

1. Introduction
	•	Purpose: Establish a robust marketplace for goods and services, implement decentralized governance mechanisms, and integrate wellness initiatives provided by Keshe Foundation.
	•	Objectives: Facilitate secure and transparent transactions, empower community-driven decision-making, and promote holistic well-being within the ecosystem.

2. Parallax Exchange Marketplace
	•	Marketplace Structure:
	•	Tab 1: Services
	•	Description: A dedicated section for one-on-one service exchanges where users can offer and hire other users for services using Presence Tokens.
	•	Services Offered: Knowledge sharing, skill-based mentoring, consulting, tutoring, and other expertise-driven services.
	•	Features:
	•	Service Listings: Users can list their services with detailed descriptions, pricing in Presence Tokens.
	•	Search and Filter: Users can search for services by user, community, location (if offline), and skill, enabling dynamic and tailored browsing.
	•	Contract Creation: Facilitate the creation of contracts for one-time or recurring services, ensuring clear terms and conditions.
	•	Reputation Integration: Service providers are rated based on their interactions, influencing trust and visibility. (-1, 0, +1) ranking is uploaded by both parties upon completion of all contracts.
	•	Tab 2: Goods
	•	Description: A section for buying and selling digital and physical goods using any cryptocurrencies.
	•	Goods Offered: Products created by Projects and individual users, including digital  and physical goods.
	•	Features:
	•	Product Listings: Projects and users can list their goods with detailed descriptions, pricing in supported cryptocurrencies, and inventory management.
	•	Secure Transactions: Utilize smart contracts to handle payments, escrow services, and automated delivery upon transaction completion.
	•	Reputation Integration: Sellers are rated based on product quality, delivery reliability, and customer service, influencing trust and visibility.
	•	Sorting and Filtering: Users can sort goods by user, project, community, and category, allowing for a customized browsing experience.
	•	Advanced Functionalities:
	•	Minimum Pricing: All goods are listed with a minimum price to maintain value integrity.
	•	NFT Receipts: Implement NFTs as receipts for tracking purposes along the supply chain, ensuring price, location and quality transparency. Each NFT shows the source materials and any value added is recorded at each stage of production, preventing price gouging and enhancing trust. This process is automated if goods are created within a project.
	•	Subscription Services: Allow recurring payments for both physical and digital goods.
	•	Access Control:
	•	Exclusive Access: Parallax Exchange is accessible only to users within the Parallax network, eliminating the need for traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, as KYC requires an external authority to validate people. This out-dated model is now obsolete.
	•	KYV Implementation: Employ Know Your Vendor (KYV) protocols using NFTs as receipts to verify and authenticate vendors while maintaining anonymity of users. Escrow wallets are used to protect customer’s cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and other potentially sensitive information including delivery locations.  
3. Decentralized Governance
	•	Governance Framework:
	•	DAO Structure: Establish a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for community-driven decision-making after 6 months.
	•	Proposal System: Users submit proposals for platform improvements, policy changes, or new features. Proposals work fundamentally as projects, but are updates to the Parallax ecosystem that will affect all users.
	•	Stages Of Development: 
	1.	User creates a DAO proposal. User outlines all relevant details about the proposal exactly as per projects. This includes the problem and the proposed solution.
	2.	Once the community votes and DAO approves, the development team would begin filling roles and allocating tokens.
	3.	Validation occurs as it does everywhere else in the network.
		Timeline: For the first 6 months all successful DAO proposals end up on the desks of the development team, who implement the suggestions they deem most important. 6 Months after launch, Parallax will move to full DAO structure. After the 6 month period users creating proposals will be fully responsible for all aspects of their proposals as the dev team steps back.

	•	Voting Mechanism:
	•	One Vote Per User: Each user has one vote, choosing “yes,” “no,” or “abstain.”
	•	Token Cost: Both “yes” and “no” votes cost 1 Presence Token, ensuring participants have a stake in their votes. “Abstain” is free.
	•	Automatic Abstention: If a user lacks sufficient Presence Tokens during the voting period, their vote defaults to “abstain.”
	•	No Vote Token Usage: Presence tokens from no votes go into a DAO specific developer pool to be used for other proposals facing over expenditure.

	•	Outcome Handling:
	•	Approved Proposals: Automatically implemented via smart contracts upon passing all voting.
	•	Rejected Proposals: “No” voters provide feedback on reasons for rejection, enhancing transparency and continuous improvement.
	•	DAO Proposals:
	•	Listing Location: DAO-driven proposals are listed in the project voting area, similar to regular projects, with distinct colour highlighting to distinguish them from non-DAO projects.
	•	Governance Processes:
	•	Voting Cycles: All DAO-based proposals follow a quarterly cycle, ensuring sufficient time for governance decisions.
	•	Live Calls: Approved proposals have the opportunity to share their visions during a live call once per quarter as part of a network update proposal.
	•	Transparency and Accountability:
	•	Audit Trails: Maintain immutable records of all governance activities and decisions.	

4. Keshe Foundation Wellness & Feeding by Plasmatic Fields
