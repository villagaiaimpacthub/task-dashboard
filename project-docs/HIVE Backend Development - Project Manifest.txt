üéØ Objective
This document serves as the central manifest for the HIVE Backend Development project, providing a comprehensive index of all task specification files and guiding the execution strategy for both the Full Production Version and the Simplified Alpha Version.
üìã How to Use This Manifest
 * Choose Your Project Scope: Decide whether to implement the "Full Production Version" or the "Simplified Alpha Version."
 * Locate Task Files: Use the index below to find the exact .md file names for the tasks within your chosen scope.
 * Execute Tasks: Feed the relevant task files to Claude Code in the recommended sequence (as outlined in the respective Master Execution Plans for each version).

 * HIVE Task Alpha 1.3 Basic Dashboard Analytics & Live Status.md (NEW Alpha Task)
üöÄ Simplified Alpha Version Execution Sequence
This sequence is designed for minimal dependencies and rapid deployment for internal alpha testing.
 * HIVE Task Alpha 0.1: Simplified Development Dashboard
 * HIVE Task Alpha 1.0: Core Backend Foundation
 * HIVE Task Alpha 1.1: Basic Task Workflow & Real-time
 * HIVE Task Alpha 1.2: Basic Infrastructure & Testing
