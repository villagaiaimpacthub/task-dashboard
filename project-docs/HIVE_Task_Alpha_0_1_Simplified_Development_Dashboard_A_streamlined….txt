 * HIVE Task Alpha 0.1: Simplified Development Dashboard (A streamlined version of the original Task 0.1)
 * HIVE Task Alpha 1.0: Core Backend Foundation (Consolidates simplified aspects of original Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)
 * HIVE Task Alpha 1.1: Basic Task Workflow & Real-time (Consolidates simplified aspects of original Tasks 2.1, 3.1)
 * HIVE Task Alpha 1.2: Basic Infrastructure & Testing (Consolidates simplified aspects of original Tasks 1.5, 5.0)
I will now start by generating the details for HIVE Task Alpha 0.1: Simplified Development Dashboard.
HIVE Task Alpha 0.1: Simplified Development Dashboard

> 
🎯 Objective
Create a basic HTML dashboard to monitor HIVE backend development progress in real-time for the core team, serving as a simple visual feedback tool and integrating a minimal subset of the original HIVE dashboard HTML.
📋 Prerequisites
 * [ ] HTML/CSS/JavaScript development environment.
 * [ ] Access to create local files and run a simple HTTP server.
 * [ ] A basic understanding of HIVE backend components (API, DB, Redis - even if not fully implemented yet).

💻 Implementation Specifications
Core Requirements
 * Develop a single index.html file to serve as the dashboard.
 * Include basic CSS (assets/css/dashboard.css) for layout and visual appeal.
 * Implement JavaScript (assets/js/dashboard.js) to display static "placeholder" sections for:
   * "Backend Health" (e.g., API Status, Database Status, Redis Status).
   * "Tasks Overview" (e.g., Total Tasks, Tasks In Progress, Completed Tasks).
   * "User Count".
 * Implement assets/js/backend-status.js to perform simple, client-side polling (e.g., every 5 seconds) to call the backend's /health endpoint (once implemented in Task Alpha 1.0).
   * Update the "Backend Health" section based on the response from /health (e.g., "API: OK", "API: ERROR").
   * For other sections (Tasks, Users), initially use mock data from assets/data/mock-status.json or display "N/A" until those APIs are implemented.
 * The dashboard should primarily focus on displaying text-based status and simple counts. No complex charts or interactive elements are required for this alpha.
 * Include a basic README.md for local setup.
Technology Stack
 * Frontend: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
 * Backend Interaction: Simple fetch API for /health endpoint.
API Specifications (for backend interaction)
 * Endpoint: The dashboard will consume the hypothetical backend GET /health endpoint (from Task Alpha 1.0).
 * Expected Response: {"status": "ok", "db_status": "connected", "redis_status": "connected"} or similar.
Database Schema (Not applicable for this frontend-only task)
✅ Acceptance Criteria
 * [ ] index.html loads successfully in a web browser.
 * [ ] Basic dashboard layout and sections (Backend Health, Tasks Overview, User Count) are visible.
 * [ ] JavaScript attempts to fetch data from http://localhost:8000/health (or whatever your backend API endpoint is).
 * [ ] "Backend Health" section updates dynamically based on the /health endpoint's response (e.g., displays "OK" or "ERROR").
 * [ ] "Tasks Overview" and "User Count" sections display static mock data or "N/A".
 * [ ] The dashboard loads completely within 3 seconds.
 * [ ] README.md provides clear instructions to run dashboard locally via a simple HTTP server.
🔐 Security Requirements (Simplified for Alpha)
 * [ ] No sensitive development or backend information is exposed directly in the dashboard HTML/JS.
 * [ ] The dashboard is purely client-side; it does not require authentication or handle any sensitive data.
 * [ ] The dashboard relies on CORS being configured correctly on the backend (handled in Task Alpha 1.0).
📊 Performance Requirements (Simplified for Alpha)
 * [ ] Dashboard loads within 3 seconds.
 * [ ] Backend health checks update every 5 seconds without UI lag.
🧪 Test Requirements (Simplified for Alpha)
 * [ ] Manual verification that index.html renders.
 * [ ] Manual verification that /health endpoint updates display.
 * [ ] Basic browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox).
🔗 Integration Points
 * Depends on:
   * Conceptual understanding of backend GET /health endpoint (to be implemented in Task Alpha 1.0).
 * Provides to:
   * Visual feedback for core team on backend development progress.
   * A very basic "dashboard" to interact with for initial testing.

  --performance-targets="load-3s"

Validation Commands
# From the hive-development-dashboard-alpha/ directory:
# Start a simple HTTP server (requires Python)
python -m http.server 8080

# Open your web browser to http://localhost:8080
# Observe the dashboard and its basic updates.

🎯 Cursor IDE Integration
 * Workspace setup: Open hive-development-dashboard-alpha/ as the root workspace in Cursor.
 * Extensions needed:
   * Live Server (for index.html preview)
 * Debug configuration: Not directly applicable for pure frontend; use browser developer tools.
 * Environment setup: Ensure Python 3.x is installed for running the simple HTTP server.
📝 Documentation Requirements
 * [ ] README.md: Basic setup guide for running dashboard locally.
 * [ ] Inline comments in assets/js/ files explaining polling logic.
Execute First: Before Task Alpha 1.0.
Provides Foundation For: Visual feedback for subsequent backend tasks.
Estimated Time: 2-4 hours for Claude Code implementation.
Complexity: 2/10 (Very focused on basic frontend display).
